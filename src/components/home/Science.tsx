            Open Bridge delivers cognitive and other health measures
            developed by content experts and validated for remote

            Platform that has supported 500k research participants, Open Bridge
            provides tools for automated iOS and Android app configuration,
            study management, and data collection.

            Open Bridge values transparency. We provide detailed descriptions
            of our methods and open access to our validation data. Convergent
            validity evidence with gold standard measures has been collected
            among healthy adults ages 20-85. Additional clinical validation and
            norming is currently underway including collection of norms and 6-,
            12- 18- and 24-month change scores are being calculated using an
            age-stratified (20-85), iOS vs Android, national sample matching the
            2020 US Census for gender, race, ethnicity, SES and level of
            education. Clinical validation is in-progress (2022-2023) for 6
            different studies in healthy and clinical samples, including persons
            at risk for MCI or AD, cognitively impaired, and those with
            Parkinson’s disease.
