          Mobile Toolbox comprises a team of clinical colleagues, cognition
          researchers, measurement scientists and technical experts with proven
          success in multiple large-scale validation and development projects.
          Co-Principal Investigators Drs. Richard Gershon and Aaron Kaat lead
          the development and validation of mobile versions of cognitive
          assessments at Northwestern University, and Dr. Mike Kellen leads the
          development of the Mobile Toolbox platform at Sage Bionetworks. Dr.
          Martin Sliwinski of Penn State University leads the integration of
          Mobile Monitoring of Cognitive Change (M2C2) into the Mobile Toolbox.

                Dr. Gershon is a Professor and Vice Chair for Research in the
                Department of Medical Social Sciences, and Professor in the
                Department of Preventive Medicine-Health and Biomedical
                Informatics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of
                Medicine. Dr. Gershon is a leading expert in the development of
                outcome measurement, with significant experience in both
                educational and health applications. In response to the
                realization that the outcomes tools he was using in clinical
                practice were outdated and failed to cover the needs of
                patients, Dr. Gershonâ€™s career has focused on the development of
                modern assessment tools. He strives to find new ways to assess
                health outcomes and methodologies and provide that information
                to clinicians in ways that can immediately impact treatment. As
                PI for the NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and
                Behavioral Function, Dr. Gershon oversaw a team of over 200
                researchers from around the world to create a large battery of
                instruments for clinical investigators to assess various areas
                within cognitive, motor, sensory, and emotional health, for
                longitudinal, clinical and comparative effectiveness research.
                He also serves as PI on the NIH Infant and Toddler Toolbox (aka
                Baby Toolbox) contract to develop a cognitive assessment battery
                for infants and children aged 1-42 months. Dr. Gershon is the
                MPI for the NIA sponsored grant Advancing Reliable Measurement
                in Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and cognitive Aging (ARMADA), which
                validates the NIH Toolbox amongst Alzheimer&rsquo;s populations
                and older age groups. In recently awarded grants, he is the
                contact PI for ToolBox Detect: Low-Cost Detection of Cognitive
                Decline in Primary Care Settings, and co-I for The MyCog Mobile
                Assessment: Development and Validation of a Telehealth Strategy
                for Routine Detection of Cognitive Impairment in Primary Care.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dr. Gershon also serves as the MPI for the Environmental
                influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) PRO Measurement Core.
                Additionally, in his former role as PI for the NIH Roadmap
                Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
                (PROMIS) Technical Center, Dr. Gershon served as technology host
                for more than 2,000 researchers and clinicians who are
                registered users of{' '}
                <a href="http://www.assessmentcenter.net">

                , a test authoring and study administration portal. Dr.
                Gershonâ€™s background is further augmented by his numerous
                publications and presentations, and role as a co-investigator
                and/or consultant on over 100 assessment development projects in
                health care, education, and certification.
